# Baseline benchmark adapters

Each file here is one **arm** of the baseline benchmark: an object implementing
the neutral `EngineAdapter` contract (see `../EngineAdapter.ts`) that the harness
drives identically. `exojs.ts` is the committed, always-present arm. A second,
optional **reference** arm can be dropped in locally.

The harness names no engine. Arms are reported purely by their own `engine` and
`config` labels — the committed tree contains exactly one label, `exojs`.

## The reference adapter slot

To measure ExoJS against another renderer on your own machine, add a single
file:

- **File name (exact):** `reference.local.ts`, in this directory.
- **Gitignored:** the `.local.ts` suffix is listed in the repository
  `.gitignore`, so it is never committed. Nothing about the other engine — not
  its name, not a dependency entry, not a number — enters the tracked tree.
- **Dependency:** install whatever the reference arm imports as a **local-only
  dev dependency** (e.g. `pnpm add -D <package> --filter <this workspace>` on
  your machine only, then revert the lockfile before committing — or use a file:/
  link). Do not commit it.
- **Discovery:** the harness discovers the module at runtime via
  `import.meta.glob('../adapters/reference.local.ts')` in `../page/harness.ts`.
  When the file is absent the glob is empty, so the benchmark runs ExoJS-only
  with no failed import and no build break. The slot is strictly **additive**:
  the committed ExoJS-only run (WebGL2 vs WebGPU, the node-count sweep, the
  structural counters) is fully useful on its own.

### Export

The module must export a factory:

```ts
import type { EngineAdapter } from '../EngineAdapter';

export const createReferenceAdapters = (): EngineAdapter[] => {
  // return one OR two adapters — see "Two configs" below
};
```

It runs **in the browser page**, not in the Node driver, so it may freely use
`document`, WebGL2/WebGPU and the reference engine's browser runtime.

### The `EngineAdapter` contract

Every arm implements (full JSDoc in `../EngineAdapter.ts`):

- `engine: string` — arm label, e.g. `'reference'`. Reported verbatim.
- `config: string` — configuration label, e.g. `'immediate'` or `'retained'`.
- `supports(backend): boolean` — `true` for each backend (`'webgl2'` /
  `'webgpu'`) this arm can run. Unsupported backends are skipped, not failed.
- `init(canvas, backend): Promise<void>` — create the engine against the given
  canvas and backend. Pin the backend explicitly; never auto-select.
- `buildScene(spec, nodeCount, seed): void` — build the scene for the archetype
  (see fairness rules below).
- `mutate(frame): void` — apply the archetype's per-frame mutation.
- `renderFrame(): void` — render exactly one frame (the harness owns cadence;
  do not start the engine's own `requestAnimationFrame` loop).
- `teardown(): void` — release the scene and engine instance.
- `gpuDevice?(): GPUDevice | null` — optional; return the live `GPUDevice` when
  initialised on `'webgpu'` so the harness can attach its structural probe (a
  WebGL2 context is instead recovered from the canvas). Return `null` otherwise.
- `mutationSignature?(): string` — optional but **strongly recommended**; return
  `mutationSignature(selectedIndices)` (from `../mutation.ts`) for the set your
  most recent `buildScene` selected. The harness asserts it against the canonical
  selection and **fails the run loudly** if it diverges, so the cross-arm
  comparison rests on a check rather than this prose (review B3). An arm that
  omits it runs, but prints a warning that its determinism is unverified.

### Two configs (the tier-gap axis)

The convention is that a reference arm exposes **one adapter per config** so the
harness can separate two questions:

- an **`immediate`** config — the reference engine driven in an immediate-mode
  style comparable to ExoJS's current path, and
- a **`retained`** config — the reference engine's retained / dirty-tracking
  tier, if it has one.

Return both from `createReferenceAdapters()` (a two-element array). Comparing the
two against ExoJS is what answers the tier-gap question: does the `retained`
config flatten a scaling curve that `immediate` tracks alongside ExoJS? If the
engine has no genuinely separable immediate tier, return a single adapter and say
so — do not present a conflated number as a tier comparison.

### Cross-arm fairness contract (MANDATORY)

Both arms must render the _same_ scene and mutate the _same_ nodes, or the
comparison is meaningless. The ExoJS adapter (`exojs.ts`) follows these rules and
any reference adapter **must** follow them identically:

1. **Same node set.** Build exactly `nodeCount` leaves for the archetype, laid
   out and nested as `spec` describes (`nestingDepth`, `textureCount`,
   `cullingEnabled`, the `overdraw` stacking).
2. **Same mutation selection.** Use `selectMutationIndices(nodeCount,
spec.mutationFraction, seed)` (from `../mutation.ts`) — the shared, canonical
   selection — to pick the leaves you mutate, and expose the result through
   `mutationSignature()` (see the contract list above). The helper seeds a fresh
   `createRng(seed)` and draws **exactly one** `rng()` value **per leaf, in
   ascending index order**, selecting the leaf when `rng() < mutationFraction`
   (drawing for _every_ leaf even when the fraction is `0`). Both arms, sharing
   this one code path, therefore select the byte-for-byte identical index set,
   and the harness verifies it. Do not re-implement the draw loop, batch,
   reorder, or draw more than one value per leaf.
3. **Same per-frame work.** `mutate(frame)` must disturb only that selected set,
   with a displacement small enough to never cross the viewport edge (so culling
   never changes the visible set mid-run).
4. **Same cadence.** One `renderFrame()` produces one frame; let the harness time
   it. Do not run the engine's internal render loop.
